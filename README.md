# Large Scale Data Engineering 2019

course website: https://event.cwi.nl/lsde/2019/cloud.shtml

## Overview 

The goal of the course is to gain insight into and experience with algorithms and infrastructures for managing big data.

This course confronts the students with some data management tasks, where the challenge is that the mere size of this data causes naive solutions, and/or solutions that work only on a single machine, to stop being practical. Solving such tasks requires the computer scientist to have insight in the main factors that underlie algorithm performance (access pattern, hardware latency/bandwidth), as well as possess certain skills and experience in managing large-scale computing infrastructure. This is the focus of the first assignment.

The course further gives an overview of the infrastructures currently at the disposal of a broad public to address large scale data analysis. In particular, cloud computing infrastructures, as well as the Hadoop software ecosystem to manage data on large clusters. In the second assignment, students perform a Big Data analysis project on a large cluster, to gain experience with these technologies. This project is also a training in practical problem solving as well as critical thinking. They also present related literature to their project in a talk, as well as write a final report.
